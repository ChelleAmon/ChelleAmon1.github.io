            Being an archipelago with different regions, the Philippines offers a wide variety of specialty desserts <br>
            made primarily of rice, coconut and fruits that are widespread in this tropical country. <br> 
            With agriculture being their main source of livelihood, rice has been a staple food of the Philippines. <br>
            Because of this, rice is not only eaten with dishes but is also an ingredient in a lot of Filipino desserts. <br>
            Some types of dessert call for rice flour while others call for glutinous or sticky rice.
